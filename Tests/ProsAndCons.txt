Thoughts:
	If some part of class functionality is his private plementation
	when it should be tested in all ways which it influence class contract.
	
	But if such functionality is moved to another class and become its public contract
	then testing of such functionality's usage can be reduced.
	
	So EACH class MUST be tested:
	(1) his own contract and
	(2) usage of contracts used classes.
